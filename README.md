# gascan

Gas Can is a publishing tool I built to host my own work. It ingests MultiMarkdown emitted from Scrivener 3, and serves up static HTML. Everything hosted in Gas Can lives in resources, indexed in an edn file.

Gas Can serves two purposes:

* To publish writing and music and whatever else using my preferred workflow, presented in the way that I want it to be presented.
* To play around with tools I find interesting.

You can find more writing about the motivations on the site itself. At least, that's the plan.

## Installation

Clone this repo. 

## Running the server

To serve content, try this:

```
$ lein run run
```

## Importing new content

To import new content, you will first need to create some in Scrivener. See below for strictures on Scrivener composition and export; Scrivener is finicky, and so am I. 

Having exported to, say, `/Users/bphillips/Documents/Focus Loops In Perspective.md`, content is managed at the REPL. First convert it to a remote post:

```
user> (gascan.remote-posts/read-remote-post 
 "/Users/bphillips/Documents/Focus Loops In Perspective.md")
{:markdown-abs-path
 "/Users/bphillips/Documents/Focus Loops In Perspective.md",
 :title "Focus Loops In Perspective",
 :timestamp 1586541922953,
 :extra-resources [],
 :dir-depth 0,
 :parsed-markdown
 #object[com.vladsch.flexmark.util.ast.Document 0x4e5efc6d "Document{}"],
 :src-path "/Users/bphillips/Documents/Focus Loops In Perspective.md"}
```

Then intern it as a draft and add the interned post to the post store:

```
user> (gascan.posts/import-and-add-post! 
 (gascan.remote-posts/read-remote-post 
  "/Users/bphillips/Documents/Focus Loops In Perspective.md"))
...etc...
```

You can verify that it is there by using `gascan.browser` to run the server and automate a Chrome session to observe the post: (`chromedriver` is required):

```
user> (gascan.browser/look-at 
 (post->title-path (posts/find-post {:title "Focus Loops In Perspective"})))
```

The `gascan.posts` module has more tools for updating posts. Usually you will want to update the filter keys to pick one or more sections the post will appear in, and then update `:status` to `:published` to serve the post publicly.

## Writing and exporting in Scrivener

When writing in Scrivener:

* To link to a file from the local file system, create a local file link. This will emit a `file:///...` link in the exported Markdown.
* Change the title of the exported Markdown to whatever you want the title of the post to be.
* Export with the following settings:
    * Plain MultiMarkdown format
    * Check the box marked "Convert links to MultiMarkdown"

### Bugs

It's ugly, and the workflow with Scrivener is finicky.
