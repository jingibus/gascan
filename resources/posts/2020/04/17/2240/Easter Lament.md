> God, I'm asking for forgiveness
> I've been faithless
> I've tried to do everything I think you want me to do
> All I want is to be strong for her

> You gave me a mission

> My skin needs touch and my body needs a braid
> I can't face it

> Buried alive
> With my finger I tread the lines
> Trampling down death
> by death you survive
> I should be grateful
> but I'm so confused
> Look at these people in this book
> They're so confused

> You gave me a mission

Written 4/17/2020 morning. I was trying to start my written meditation on one of those Easter Week post-crucifixion readings and I just couldn't deal. My practice is to seek actionable guidance in these meditations; I was frustrated. So I wrote a song.
