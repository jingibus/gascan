I live alone.
I generally like living alone. I like being on the internet. I like working on projects by myself. Left to my own devices, I will sit in my eyrie looking out over the Fillmore and read, argue, type, play games, and so on until the end of time.
I guess people call that kind of person an "introvert," and when I compare myself to other people I can't deny that's what I am. But being an introvert doesn't mean living in isolation, and I've found that finding happiness as an introvert can't be found alone.
Well, not totally alone. I do have a demanding cat. But a cat isn't a person.

### Sanity is found in groups

If you're worried about going crazy in the lockdown (and you should be), the single most important thing to discard is the idea that sanity and happiness is something that can be found by yourself. Running is great. Waking up early is great. Having a pet is great, meditation is great, eating well is great, there are so many things you can that are great and that will help, but none of us are individuals in isolation.
There's not a lot of analytical evidence that this is the case. Analytical techniques require focusing on and isolating elements of interest, so it's much easier to apply them to people as individuals. But there is some out there: Bruce Alexander's famous "Rat Park" studies and later followups showed that addiction more than a matter of dangerous substances. It's also a matter of social isolation. Simply put, rats are active, social creatures, and if they have an active place in rat society the phenomenon of addiction doesn't emerge.
In Alexander's later research and writing, he doesn't even restrict himself to drugs and alcohol. He makes the case that addiction is a more general phenomenon, and that most addictions are not the kinds of substance abuse we usually associate with the term. He claims that addiction is a result of fragmented societies.
"Psychosocial integration." That's the positive term he uses, and that I like to use: being a person among people. It is an awkward term for a great truth:

> No man is an island,  entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were;  any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.

Our friends and our family, our cities and our nations are as much a part of us as our fingers and our toes are. We all want to find home: home for me means psychosocial integration. Or just home, if I want to use words like a normal person.
So that's point one: if you live alone or alone-ish and you want to be happy in this time of social isolation, prioritize connection. And take it easy on yourself: you can't be 100% if you're cut off from the people you know, because they're a part of you.

### Connection is a high bandwidth activity

We aren't called social apes for nothing: most of our brainpower and development growing up and most of our literature and culture is concerned with our relationships with one another.
And you can't fool us with technology, either. We know if our friend is there or if we're looking at a photograph. We can smell our lovers, and we can feel their hands. We know.
Facebook knows this, too, by the way. The most memorable talk I saw at my orientation at Facebook was Chris Cox's analysis of where the company's different businesses fit into the world of communication. It was an exegesis of the mission of social connection.
A key point was that text doesn't make those connections as well as pictures, pictures not as well as videos, and videos not as well as VR. These all take up different amounts of our bandwidth --- our attention bandwidth, and our megabytes bandwidth. When you can't leave the house, that communication bandwidth is the most valuable asset you have for addressing social needs.
What are you spending yours on? Are you spending it on text? Why? I'm guilty of it too, but it's a pennywise tactic. We're like people who've lost the ocean, and are trying to replace it by wetting our hands under a faucet. It's convenient. It's better than nothing. It doesn't work.
So that's point two: bias towards high bandwidth modes of communication over low bandwidth as much as is feasible. Video calls beat phone calls beat text messages. VR? Sure, why not. If you can find a way to smell a loved one, do that, too. And if you can safely take a socially distant walk in the park with them, that's even better.

### Make your own social network

When you see someone driving a car on the road, what thoughts pop into your head?
Have you ever backed away from someone in public? Why?
How do you navigate a crowd? Or talk to someone new at a party?
What do you do on the weekend? Who do you see? How do you decide who you want to see?
This all may sound like an extended anxiety attack, but if we are out and about on any given day, our brain is doing people work. It's like balancing on two legs: at great cost we learn it in childhood, and now we do it constantly without thinking about it. We swim in social space like fish.
A lot of that is work deciding who we will and will not associate with. The biggest decisions in our life are about which people we will be around: college, marriage, employment. And while there's a lot of ceremony on the way there, we chisel those decisions into stone by using physical space, by putting ourselves physically near what's important to us. Even working from home makes a statement.
Well, guess what? We don't have the tool of physical space anymore.
What we do have are a raft of technical tools that would seem to solve that problem. Facebook (and Instagram) is the exemplar: their mission is to connect the people of the world, and in my view they've done the most thinking about what that means. But other lesser tools like Slack, Discord, Twitter, and even point to point messaging apps like WhatsApp and SMS are doing the same thing, too, to a greater or lesser degree.
But they also take charge of this work for you. When we spend time on Facebook, Facebook does the people work for us. And while Twitter's linear timeline doesn't do the same kind of selection Facebook does, we still cede that day to day people work to the timeline. There's no equivalent to what we'd do in the real world: "Tim is talking about politics again? I'll sit at the other end of the table today."
When it comes to actually building a social network that works for you, these tools are bad and they do not work. They may do a great job of holding our attention, but they don't serve our day-to-day needs. How could they? Many people realize this one day when they have that now common experience: "Wait, am I really happy here? Is this really a good part of my life? I should quit."
So that's point three: build your own social network! Social media is not evil, but we've given it precious burdens that is not fit to bear. Reflect on who is important to you and reach out to them. Maybe even make a list; I did. Organize VC dinner parties. (I didn't. But I go to them! They're a good idea, I swear.)

### Take it easy

The last thing I want to say is something I also said earlier: take it easy.
I did not write this big long essay because I am worth emulating. The people worth emulating right now are the last people who would ever sit down and spend three hours on a Wednesday afternoon crafting an action item list explaining how important socializing is when you're isolating at home. They would just be doing it, because that's what they know to do instinctively.
As I said at the start, I wrote this big long essay because I am bad at this. Much like paying the bills, I have tried not doing it and have found that the results do not meet my standard for joy. Hope springs eternal, though, and I keep trying to skip this hard work or forget about it. None of this is obvious to me; if it were, I wouldn't need to write about it.
That's okay. I do not have to be perfect to get through the day. There will be tough days, but the tough days will come to an end. And if you don't believe that, you'll just have to wait and see to prove me wrong.
